This project will incorperate a lot of ideas
I have latley.

Use R to scrape data, mainley from CRAN to get dependencies 
of packages.  This would be used to create a network of what
is dependent on what.  Maybe other things could come fro mit as well
like showing which packages are teh least stable, which ones are
hubs, etc.  Maybe for some of this a network over time would be 
needed.

Create networks and network visualizations.

Really ise R for a project, use version control over.

Make a interesting interface which can show visualizations and 
take some form of user input.

Would alos be very cool to do most of this interface in shiny.

Could I store this graph in Titan or Neo4j, have a connection
and a method to pull data from this database.  Then make plots in 
both igraph and even a hoo to Gephi.  This would allow me to use 
RServe more.

Make things in an interfacable manner so that any peice can be worked 
on at any time, not having to start with getting data.

data can come from cran and inside-r
